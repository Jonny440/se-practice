# SIS #03 — Report: Smart Campus Room Availability Checker

## 1. Setup and reuse

<!-- Model: the exact model with its version, as the tool shows it ("ChatGPT" is a tool, not a
     model). If the tool does not show it, write: not displayed
     Reuse: week-05 if code/original/booking_v1.py is your Week 05 v1, copied unedited;
     week-06 if web/original/ is your Week 06 v1 export; fresh if you generated it for this SIS. -->

## 2. Baseline — before any new AI exchange

<!-- Written by you, without AI, before the first exchange of this SIS. Commit and push it
     first (README §2). Reusing Week 05/06 work does not exempt you: this section is new. -->

### 2.1 Scope in my own words

**Scope:** The user is a student, who can search through a catalog of rooms, select a needed room, check its availability and create a booking. After creation the user gets a confirmation message and can cancel the booking using the system.

### 2.2 The acceptance criteria in my own words

| AC | In my own words |
| --- | --- |
| AC1 | The booking may be created throughout the whole day, where day is from 0 to 1440|
| AC2 | The maximum booking time is 120 minutes |
| AC3 | Some rooms are blocked and may not be booked |
| AC4 | Reject the booking, which overlap with other booking |
| AC5 | Show a clear message, if the room available or not and do not change the initial booking array data |
| AC6 | The system should be accessible from any device |

### 2.3 Likely failure points

<!-- At least two. The brief's examples: endpoint overlap, starts-now. -->

| # | Failure point | AC | How I will check it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Boundary data booking | AC1 | use the boundary data like 1440; 0 |
| 2 | Overlapping bookings. Last time it did not calculate the booking time and thus could not tell if bokkings overlap | AC4 | Use dummy data inside the existing array and try to create new booking |

### 2.4 The contract

| Parameter | Meaning | Type and allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | Starting time of the booking | Integer from 0 to 1440 |
| `end` | Ending time of the booking | Integer from 0 to 1440 |
| `now` | The time right now. (For testing purposes it should be adjustable) | Integer from 0 to 1439 |
| `blocked` | Variable to check if the room is blocked or not | Boolean |
| `existing` | An array of existing booking, to check for overlap | Array of tuples containing start and end time |
| returns | True or false, whether this room is available for booking | Boolean |

### 2.5 Initial assumptions and manual checks

**Assumptions:**

1. The booking end time is allowed to be 1440
2. The booking time should be higher than 0 minutes

**Checked manually:**

- Nothing checked manually

## 3. Python v1 review

<!-- One row per conditional branch in code/original/booking_v1.py (your language's v1 on
     Path B). Quote the condition exactly. AC1-AC4 must all appear in the AC column. -->

| Branch in v1 (quoted) | AC | Satisfies it? | Why |

## 5. Test cases — executed on both artifacts

<!-- Base for every case unless the row says otherwise: now = 540, blocked = False,
     existing = [(600, 660)]. Do not change the first four columns.
     Python columns: True, False or Error (it raised) — what the call actually returned.
       T11: the result of the SECOND call. T12: n/a.
       Path A: the checker runs both of your files on T1-T11 and compares (C2, C3).
     Page columns: Available, Unavailable or Not testable — what the page actually showed.
     Never write a result you did not observe. -->

| Case | Name | Input | Expected | Python v1 | Python final | Page v1 | Page final |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Touching | 660–720 | Available | | | | |
| T2 | Overlap | 630–690 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T3 | Blocked | 660–720, blocked | Unavailable | | | | |
| T4 | Exactly 120 min | 720–840 | Available | | | | |
| T5 | 121 min | 720–841 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T6 | Starts now | 540–570 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T7 | Reversed | 720–660 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T8 | Ends at midnight | 1380–1440 | Available | | | | |
| T9 | Past midnight | 1380–1441 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T10 | Second booking | 720–780, existing (600–660), (700–760) | Unavailable | | | | |
| T11 | Same check twice | 660–720, twice | Available | | | | |
| T12 | Narrow screen | T1 at ~375 px wide | Available | n/a | n/a | | |

## 6. Traceability

<!-- His table. Implementation / file: where the rule lives (booking.py line, a component).
     Test input: the case IDs from section 5. v1 / final actual: what those cases gave. -->

| AC | Implementation / file | Test input | Expected | v1 actual | Final actual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC1 | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| AC2 | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

## 7. Issue log

<!-- At least two, from v1 — a functional defect and a usability or code-quality issue where you
     have them. If every case passed on v1, log the preventive cleanup and say why.
     Reproduction names a case (T1-T12) or an AC. Priority: High, Medium or Low.
     Prompt / change: the focused prompt you sent, and what changed. Never "make it better". -->

| # | Issue | Reproduction | Priority | Prompt / change | Retest result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| 2 | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

**Before / after:** `evidence/before-1.png` → `evidence/after-1.png` show issue (write here)

## 8. Critique decisions

<!-- The AI's review against AC1-AC6 (stage C), claim by claim. At least three rows.
     How I verified it: the case, test or run that confirmed or refuted the claim.
     Decision: accept, reject or modify. At least one reject or modify — the reflection asks for it. -->

| # | AI claim or recommendation | How I verified it | Decision | Reason (AC or case) |

## 9. Coding-agent analysis

### 9.1 The loop

<!-- One real pass through the loop from this assignment — with your assistant or with Bolt. -->

| Step | What happened in this assignment |
| --- | --- |
| User goal | (write here) |
| Model / plan | (write here) |
| Tool call | (write here) |
| Observation | (write here) |
| Next step | (write here) |
| Human review | (write here) |

### 9.2 Context, tools and permissions

<!-- At least three rows. Last column: Observed (you saw it happen) or Assumed (you infer it
     about the internals). Use both at least once. -->

| Tool | Context it used | Tools or permissions | Observed or assumed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

### 9.3 Checkpoint and dependability

**Safety checkpoint:** (write here)

**Reliability, security, responsibility:** (write here)

## 10. Reflection

<!-- 100-200 words, in your own words, no AI. Compare AI-assisted coding (the Python part) with
     vibe coding (the Bolt part); one example each of a reliability, an availability/usability and
     a security risk; why review, tool permissions and tests stay human responsibilities; one AI
     recommendation you rejected or modified, and why; what you would improve next without
     expanding the scope. -->

(write here)

## 11. Appendix A — AI exchanges

<!-- At least four. Complete prompts and complete responses, as text — never screenshots. Paste
     each inside the ~~~~ block that follows its label.
     Stage: Plan, Generate, Critique or Repair (the brief's A-D) — at least one of each.
     Source: this SIS, week-05 or week-06. Reused exchanges keep their original date.
     The Generate exchange for Python must contain your v1 exactly as it is in code/original/.
     Add B5, B6 … if you ran more. -->

## 12. Appendix B — Test output

### 12.1 Your suite

~~~~text
(paste here)
~~~~

### 12.2 Path B only — three faults you planted

<!-- Path A: leave this table as it is. Path B: three rows — the line you broke, the AC it
     breaks, the test that failed. -->

| # | Line you broke | AC | Test that failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

## 13. Remaining limitations and known fails

<!-- One row per check ID in submission.yml known_fails, and any limitation you know of.
     If the checker is clean and you know of none, one row that says so. -->

| Check ID or limitation | Why it stays | What I would do next |
